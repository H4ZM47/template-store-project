            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: In cybersecurity, a vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact</strong>: Impact refers to the degree of harm that could be caused to an organization's assets, operations, or individuals if a vulnerability is exploited.</li>
                <li><strong>Severity</strong>: Severity is a measure of the seriousness of a vulnerability or threat, based on factors like potential impact, ease of exploitation, and scope of affected systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk</strong>: In IT and cybersecurity, risk is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Technology Asset</strong>: An IT asset is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability Response/Remediation</strong>: The process of managing a security vulnerability through identification, assessment, prioritization, and correction.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Testing</strong>: The process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Ad-hoc Testing</strong>: Testing performed informally and randomly without a formal test plan.</li>
                <li><strong>Periodic Testing</strong>: Testing IT systems and controls on a regular, scheduled basis.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Testing</strong>: Using software tools to run tests automatically without much human intervention.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Testing</strong>: Manually testing software for defects with a tester playing the role of an end user.</li>
                <li><strong>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)</strong>: A standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities in software.</li>
                <li><strong>CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)</strong>: A category system for software weaknesses and vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)</strong>: A list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws with unique identifiers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <p>Testing is conducted using automated tools and manual processes to identify vulnerabilities in DroneSense information technology assets. Testing is performed continuously, ad-hoc, and on periodic schedules.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Categorization</h2>
            <p>All identified vulnerabilities are categorized based on their severity using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) as follows:</p>
            <div class="severity-table">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Critical Severity</strong>: CVSS score 9.0 - 10.0</li>
                    <li><strong>High Severity</strong>: CVSS score 7.0 - 8.9</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium Severity</strong>: CVSS score 4.0 - 6.9</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Severity</strong>: CVSS score 0.1 - 3.9</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Remediation</h2>
            <p>Vulnerabilities are to be remediated within the following timelines based on their categorization:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Critical Severity</strong>: Remediation efforts must begin immediately upon detection, and completed within 30 days.</li>
                <li><strong>High Severity</strong>: Remediation efforts must begin within 30 days of detection, and completed within 60 days.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium Severity</strong>: Remediation efforts must begin within 60 days of detection, and completed within 180 days.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Severity</strong>: Remediation efforts must begin within 180 days of detection, and completed within 360 days.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reporting</h2>
            <p>Reports of vulnerability information will be generated and delivered as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weekly</strong> metrics of vulnerability KPIs (e.g. number of critical vulnerabilities outside of remediation timeline, total number of vulnerabilities by severity, top 5 most vulnerable assets).</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly</strong> vulnerability briefing documents for the L10 leadership team including prior month vulnerability metrics, overall vulnerability metrics, status reports of vulnerability remediation efforts, and a full set of vulnerability details suitable for independent analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Quarterly</strong> vulnerability status reports for the Board of Directors.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Reports</strong>: In case of exploitation of a vulnerability, an incident report detailing the event, its impact, and the response action taken, is to be prepared by Security.</li>
            </ul>
